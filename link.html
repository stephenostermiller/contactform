Linking to the <a href="./">contact form</a> on your server is very straightforward.  My contact form 
(on ostermiller.org) is in the root directory of the webserver, so it is simply<br>
http://ostermiller.org/contact.pl.
<p>
If your contact form is in your cgi-bin directory, the link will likely look something
like this:<br>
http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/contact.pl
<p>
If you want to link to your contact form with prefilled data, there are two ways to do so.
<h2><a name=hidden_subject>Appending Hidden Text to Subject</a></h2>
I create multiple links to the same contact form from various places on my website.  Because
users do not always do a good job of providing a meaningful subject I like to have some idea
what section of my site they came from to the contact form.  I do this using the "regarding"
parameter.  The contents of the regarding parameter appear in parenthesis after the user entered
subject in the emails that you receive.  For example:<br>
contact.pl?regarding=Moose+Tracks<br>
contact.pl?regarding=Baking+Cookies<br>
Use pluses instead of spaces so that all browsers handle the link correctly.
<p>
An email from a user might look like this:
<pre>From: Joe User <joe@example.com>
Subject: I love your site!!!! (Moose Tracks)

It was the only site on the Internet I could find with the information I was looking for.
Thanks so much, and keep up the good work.</pre>
<p>
At this point you know they were talking about your moose tracking page rather than your cookie
baking page.

<h2><a name=prefill_data>Prefilling Data</a></h2>
If you desire to set the subject (or any field) for the user, it is very easy to do.  Simply, 
put a parameter with that field into your link.  To error messages about incomplete forms (or to prevent the form actually being submitted if it is complete) use the prefill parameter as well:<br>
contact.pl?subject=Loved+the+omni&prefill<br>
contact.pl?subject=Hated+the+omni&prefill<br>

<h2><a name=embed>Embedding the Form in Other Pages</a></h2>

<p>You may want to have the form itself as part of a larger page.  To do this, you only need to copy the javascript and the form out of page source and place them on other page.  The form will then submit to the contact form page.   You can get by without the javascript if you remove the onsubmit="..." from the &lt;form&gt; tag.</p>
