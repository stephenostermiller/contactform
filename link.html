Linking to the <a href="./">contact form</a> on your server is very staightforward.  My contact form 
(on ostermiller.org) is in the root directory of the webserer, so it is simply<br>
http://ostermiller.org/contact.pl.
<p>
If your contact form is in your cgi-bin directory, the link will likely look something
like this:<br>
http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/contact.pl
<p>
If you want to link to your contact form with prefilled data, there are two ways to do so.
<h3>Additional Subject Matter</h3>
I create multilple links to the same contact form from various places on my website.  Because
users do not always do a good job of providing a meaningful subject I like to have some idea
what section of my site they came from to the contact form.  I do this using the "regarding"
parameter.  The contents of the regarding parameter appear in parenthesis after the user entered
subject in the emails that you receive.  For example:<br>
contact.pl?regarding=Moose+Tracks<br>
contact.pl?regarding=Baking+Cookies<br>
Use plusses instead of spaces so that all browsers handle the link correctly.
<p>
An email from a user might look like this:
<pre>From: Joe User <joe@example.com>
Subject: I love your site!!!! (Moose Tracks)

It was the only site on the internet I could find with the information I was looking for.
Thanks so much, and keep up the good work.</pre>
<p>
At this point you know they were talking about your moose tracking page rather than your cookie
baking page.

<h3>Prefilling Data</h3>
If you desire to set the subject (or any field) for the user, it is very easy to do.  Simply, 
put a paremeter with that field into your link.  To error messages about incomplete forms (or the
form actually being submitted if it is complete) use the prefill parameter as well:<br>
contact.pl?subect=Loved+the+omni&prefill<br>
contact.pl?subect=Hated+the+omni&prefill<br>
