<!-- Page structure - the look and feel of the page
     This variable may be either changed directly, or if the
     page_template_file variable is set, this variable is
     ignored and the template file is used instead.
     Contact form can place content into any of four places:
     $title - the title of the page
     $css - style rules that control how the form looks
     $javascript - client side validation rules.
     $content - the form itself.
     The css and title variables are optional and can easily
     be omitted and replaced with your own elements to better
     suit your taste.  The form will not work properly if either
     the javascript or content variables are removed or duplicated.-->

<!-- FormFields is the list of questions the user is expected
     to answer. The questions will appear in the same order as
     they are ordered here. You may safely remove the subject,
     email, name, and message from the form. The to field should
     not be removed. The name of each field should contain only
     letters, numbers, and underscore.  Spaces or symbols should
     not be used.  Each has several attributes that control the
     display of the question to the user.

     "required"
     a regular expression that describes what a valid submission looks
     like.  By default, any entry at all is allowed.
     Consider using the following pre-defined regular expressions:
     $SOMETHING, $ANYTHING, $ONE_LINE_REQUIRED, $ONE_LINE_OPTIONAL,
     $ZIPCODE_REQUIRED, $ZIPCODE_OPTIONAL, $PHONE_REQUIRED,
     $PHONE_OPTIONAL, $EMAIL_REQUIRED, $EMAIL_OPTIONAL, $PRICE_REQUIRED,
     $PRICE_OPTIONAL, $FLOAT_REQUIRED, $FLOAT_OPTIONAL,
     $INTEGER_REQUIRED, $INTEGER_OPTIONAL, $BLANK, $PHONE_NO_AREA_CODE_OPTIONAL, 
     $PHONE_NO_AREA_CODE_REQUIRED

     "error"
     A user friendly error message for each required
     element that a user gets wrong.

     "type"
     Type of input in web pages for each field.
     Currently supported are 'text', 'hidden', 'radio',
     'select', and 'textarea'
     If there is no type, 'text' is assumed.
     Setting the type for the to field will have no effect since
     the to field is handled specially.

     "description"
     Description to appear next to entry forms and in
     the email or $NO_DESCRIPTION for none
     If no description is given the field name followed
     by a colon is used

     "selected"
     For fields of type "select", or "radio" indicates
     the default selection

     "special"
     Any special purpose for which the field is used.
     Must be one of "to", "from", "name", "subject",
     "regarding", or "referrer" -->
